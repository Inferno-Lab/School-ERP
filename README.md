# EduNest

EduNest is a school platform with four parts that work together:

| Part | What it is | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **School admin** | The website a school's office and principal use: dashboard, students, attendance, fees, notices, timetable, settings. | `apps/admin` |
| **Console** | EduNest's own control room: onboard a school, set up its database and address, roll out releases, watch health, give support, bill, manage the team. | `apps/console` |
| **Backend** | Two NestJS APIs (one for schools, one for the console) in one process, with a PostgreSQL database per school. | `apps/api`, `apps/console-api`, `apps/server`, `packages/*` |
| **Mobile app** | A Flutter app for students, parents and teachers ("Chalk & Glass" look). Built for a school (`SCHOOL` and `API_BASE_URL`), it signs in for real and reads that school's data through the family API (`/v1/f/*`); built without them, it runs on demo content. | `lib/`, `android/`, `ios/` |

Start here depending on who you are:

- **New developer or coding agent:** [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (rules and commands), then [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) (what was built, why, what is left and how to do it).
- **Want to see it running on the internet:** [`docs/deploy-free-test.md`](docs/deploy-free-test.md). The current test deployment is `https://edunest-0c6x.onrender.com` (admin at `/`, console at `/console/`).
- **The design:** the concept is [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) and the approved boards are in [`design/`](design/README.md). The long-term plan is [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-14-edunest-platform-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-14-edunest-platform-design.md).

## How it fits together

```
 Browser: school admin (React)  ─┐                          ┌─ one PostgreSQL database per school
 Browser: console (React)       ─┼─►  apps/server  ─────────┤
 Phone: Flutter app             ─┘   (NestJS, Fastify)      └─ one registry database (the list of schools)
                                      ├─ school API   /v1/*          (tenant chosen by the X-School header)
                                      ├─ console API  /console/v1/*  (EduNest staff only)
                                      └─ serves the admin at / and the console at /console/
```

- **One database per school.** The *registry* database lists schools and holds each school's sealed connection string. A request to `/v1/...` names its school in the `X-School` header; the server looks the school up, opens (or reuses) a connection pool to that school's database and answers from it.
- **Everything configurable lives in data.** A school's modules, plan limits, settings and locks are layered (platform defaults, plan, school settings, platform locks) and resolved by `packages/config-engine`. The admin changes settings; the app and the API read them.
- **Onboarding is a recipe.** The console's wizard collects the school's details, then a *blueprint* (a versioned list of seven steps: database, keys and storage, migrations and defaults, domain, first admin, app build profile, store checklist) creates the school. Each step is retryable and logged. Where it runs (`local`, `free-test`, `aws-cell`) only changes which driver does the step.
- **Risky console actions need a second person** (erase, suspend, push plan changes, run migrations...). Support staff can open a school's admin read-only for an hour with a signed token; the school API refuses every write from it.

## Run it on your computer

Needs Node 24 and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`). No Docker: a throwaway PostgreSQL is started from an npm package.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build                          # once, builds the shared packages
bash tools/dev-reset.sh &           # starts PostgreSQL (port 54329), the server (4000) and creates the Greenfield demo school; takes ~1 minute
pnpm --filter @edunest/admin dev    # http://localhost:5173/s/greenfield
pnpm --filter @edunest/console dev  # http://localhost:5174
```

Sign in:

| Where | Address | Credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| School admin (demo school) | `http://localhost:5173/s/greenfield` | `neha.menon@greenfield.edu.in` / `nest2026`, then press "Type the demo code" (`424242`) |
| Console | `http://localhost:5174` | `kaushal@edunest.app` / `nest2026`, code `424242` |
| Phone app on the demo school | a build with `SCHOOL=greenfield` | parent `priya.sharma@example.com`, student `aarav.sharma@edunest.app`, teacher `kavita.iyer@greenfield.edu.in`; password `nest2026`, code `424242` |

On the hosted test track (`https://edunest-0c6x.onrender.com`) the school logins are the same. The console there uses `BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` and `DEMO_CODE` from Render's Environment page.

Texts and emails are never sent for real: they land in the console's **Test inbox**. That is where a new school's invite and sign-in codes appear.

## Check that nothing is broken

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test         # types and 132 unit and API tests (the API tests start a real PostgreSQL)
node tools/audit-ui.mjs             # every page, 4 widths, light and dark: errors, overflow, clipped text
node tools/e2e-flows.mjs            # 38 click-through flows in a real browser (run after dev-reset; it changes demo data)
node tools/scan-cutoff.mjs          # text cut by an ellipsis, hidden scrollbars, clipped boxes (the audit does not see these)
node tools/scan-gaps.mjs            # side-by-side columns that end unevenly, blank inside cards, content short of the edge
node tools/scan-fit.mjs             # tab knobs off their tab, text wrapping in pills or spilling out, 'undefined' on screen
node tools/scan-scroll.mjs          # slow scroll areas and table headings that scroll away
node tools/e2e-onboard.mjs          # onboards a new empty school through the wizard and screenshots every page
tool/verify.sh                      # Flutter analyzer and tests
```

`tools/shot.mjs <url> out.png [width] [height] [--dark] [--console] [--audit] [--do '[...]']` takes one screenshot while signed in, which is how pages are looked at without a window.

## Deploying

The free test track is one Render web service plus a free Neon database: [`docs/deploy-free-test.md`](docs/deploy-free-test.md). `render.yaml` describes it, so connecting the repository is enough. Pushing or merging to `main` redeploys it.

## The Flutter app

The original demo app (students, parents, teachers; Chalk & Glass; mock JSON in `assets/mock`) lives at the repository root. How to run it, the demo accounts, its architecture and rules are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); machine setup is in [`docs/dev-environment.md`](docs/dev-environment.md). In short:

```bash
flutter pub get && flutter run          # demo content, no backend needed
flutter run --dart-define=SCHOOL=greenfield --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://edunest-0c6x.onrender.com   # the demo school's real data (password nest2026, code 424242)
```

Demo accounts on demo content (password `demo123`, OTP `123456`): student Aarav Sharma, parent Priya Sharma, teacher Kavita Iyer. On a school build the same people sign in with `nest2026` and code `424242`.
