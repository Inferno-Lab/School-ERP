# Platform build status (2026-10-18, after the second session)

Merged to `main` (work branch `feat/platform`). The plan is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-14-edunest-platform-design.md`; this file says what of it exists.
Deploying the free test track: `docs/deploy-free-test.md`. The full hand-off (decisions, how to continue, what is left) is `docs/HANDOFF.md`; the design concept is `docs/DESIGN.md`. Live test deployment: `https://edunest-0c6x.onrender.com` (admin `/`, console `/console/`).

## What exists and is checked

| Part | Where | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace (pnpm + Turborepo), CI, Render blueprint | root, `.github/workflows`, `render.yaml` | `pnpm build`, `typecheck`, `test` all green |
| Contracts, config engine, security, db (schemas, migrations, migrator, Greenfield seed), tenancy, api-client, web-ui | `packages/*` | 9 + 4 + 4 + 13 + 1 + 6 + 3 unit tests |
| School API (sign-in with code, lockout, refresh rotation, students, attendance, fees, approvals, timetable, dashboard, settings and plan usage, search, audit, support-session read-only tokens) | `apps/api` | 27 tests on a real PostgreSQL |
| Console API (blueprints, wizard, provisioning drivers, approvals, releases in waves, migrations, health, support, flags, billing, team, sandbox inbox, build callback, demo seed on first start) | `apps/console-api` | 19 tests; schools are really created and signed in to |
| One process: both APIs, the admin at `/`, the console at `/console/` | `apps/server` | production build run locally and audited |
| School admin: sign-in, dashboard, students, timetable, attendance, fees, invoices, homework, exams, staff, admissions, reports, messages, events, notices, settings (General, Modules, App layout, Roles and access, Notifications, Message templates, Privacy and consent, Audit log), phone home and dock, public status page, design-system page | `apps/admin` | see below |
| Console: sign-in, fleet, school (overview, entitlements, versions, health, audit), onboarding wizard, releases (editable waves), migrations, cells (add, manage, move a school), builds, flags (with kill switches), blueprints and rules, health, approvals, support, test inbox, billing, compliance, team | `apps/console` | see below |
| App: with the `SCHOOL` and `API_BASE_URL` build profile it signs in for real and reads the family API (`/v1/f/*`); without it, demo content | `lib/` + `apps/api/src/school/family.*` | `flutter test` 43 pass, 12 family API tests, a live probe against a running school |

UI checks, all repeatable:

- `node tools/audit-ui.mjs`: every page of both apps at 360, 390, 768 and 1440 wide, light and dark. Fails on console errors, failed calls, sideways scroll and anything clipped or outside the window.
- `node tools/e2e-flows.mjs` (21 flows): sign-in errors, add student, dashboard approval, timetable clash fix and publish, settings save, search and shortcuts, phone dock, console release, flags, team, support and erase guards, billing.
- `node tools/e2e-onboard.mjs`: onboards a new empty school through the console wizard, signs in to it with the code from the test inbox, and screenshots every admin page (the brand-new-school states).
- `node tools/shot.mjs <url> out.png [w] [h] [--dark] [--console] [--audit] [--do '[...]']`: one screenshot, signed in.

## Not done, on purpose or not yet

- **Mobile**: the shell does not yet hide tabs for modules a school switched off (needs `/v1/config`), library catalogue and reservations, gallery, transport stops and live position, assistant, push registration, offline store, deep links; moving `lib/` to `apps/mobile`, the EduNest picker app, store pipelines and code push (plan section 19). A real phone and the liquid glass shader were not checked.
- **Admin**: none of the new pages has had the owner's design review (no canvas boards exist for them); no Hindi or Marathi for admin text; quiet hours only mark sandbox messages as held.
- **Console**: a data-copying move between servers (aws-cell), catalog update offers, real backups beyond Neon, release deployment that does more than record versions, Razorpay and GST invoices.
- **Hosting and security**: only the free test track; tokens are still in `localStorage` (plan section 17 asks for cookies, CSP, passkeys, TOTP, rate limits per IP, a password reset flow); AWS, Razorpay and SMS providers need the owner's accounts.
- **Not verified**: the deployed environment after this session's push (needs a Render deploy), a real phone, iOS.
- Visual match with the canvas was checked by eye against the boards, not by pixel diff, because the pages show real data and the boards show sample data.

## Rules worth remembering

- Never regenerate migrations once a real database has applied them: add a new file (the migrator refuses changed files).
- `tools/dc-to-tsx.mjs` and `convert-all.sh` are for the first import of a board only. The generated views have been edited by hand since.
- Pages not in the canvas are composed only from approved components (`packages/web-ui`, `apps/console/src/console.css`).
