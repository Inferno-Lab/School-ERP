# Deploy the free test track

One free web service on Render runs everything: the school API, the console API, the school admin (at `/`) and the console (at `/console/`). A free Neon database holds the school list and each school's own database. Nothing here costs money. When Render's free service is idle for 15 minutes it sleeps; the next visit takes about a minute to wake it. That is fine for testing.

You make two accounts (Neon and Render). Everything else is in this repository.

## 1. Neon: the database

1. Go to **neon.tech** and sign up (GitHub or Google works).
2. Create a project called `edunest`. Region: **Singapore** (closest to India). Postgres version: the newest offered.
3. On the project page press **Connect**. Under *Connection string*:
   - switch **Connection pooling** to **off** (the console needs the *direct* connection),
   - copy the string. It starts with `postgresql://` and ends with `?sslmode=require`.
4. Keep that string private. You paste it in step 3 below.

Free limits: 0.5 GB storage per project. The demo school with 1,498 students uses well under that.

## 2. GitHub: the code

The repository already exists at `Inferno-Lab/School-ERP`. Render builds from `main` (the owner's service tracks it), so a change goes live only once it is on `main`.

## 3. Render: the service

1. Go to **render.com** and sign up with GitHub. Allow it to read `School-ERP`.
2. **New +** → **Blueprint** → pick `School-ERP` → branch `main` → **Connect**.
3. Render reads `render.yaml` and shows one service, `edunest`. It asks for three values:
   - `REGISTRY_DATABASE_URL`: paste the Neon string.
   - `SHARED_PG_ADMIN_URL`: paste the **same** Neon string.
   - `DEMO_CODE`: six digits you choose, for example `482915`. The console asks for it after your password.
4. Press **Apply**. The first build takes 6 to 10 minutes.
5. When the service says **Live**, open `https://<your-service>.onrender.com`.

If `edunest` is already taken as a name, Render proposes another one. That is fine: nothing else depends on the name.

## 4. Sign in

| Where | Address | Sign in with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Console | `https://<service>.onrender.com/console/` | `kaushal@edunest.app`, the password from Render → your service → **Environment** → `BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`, then your `DEMO_CODE` |
| Demo school admin | `https://<service>.onrender.com/s/greenfield` | `neha.menon@greenfield.edu.in`, password `nest2026`, then press *Type the demo code* |
| Phone app (a build for `greenfield`) | the app | parent `priya.sharma@example.com`, student `aarav.sharma@edunest.app`, teacher `kavita.iyer@greenfield.edu.in`; password `nest2026`, code `424242` |

The demo school Greenfield is created by the first start (a minute or two; watch it appear on the console's Fleet page). Anyone with the address can open the demo school, so keep real data out of this environment.

Texts and emails are caught in the console under **Test inbox**; nothing is sent to real phones. New schools created from **Onboarding** get their invite and sign-in codes there.

## 5. Optional: Android app builds

The console's **Build Android app** starts a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/mobile-build.yml`) that builds the APK and posts the install link back.

1. GitHub → your profile → *Settings* → *Developer settings* → *Personal access tokens* → fine-grained token for `School-ERP` with **Actions: read and write** and **Contents: read and write**.
2. In Render → **Environment** add `GITHUB_TOKEN` (that token) and `GITHUB_REPO` = `Inferno-Lab/School-ERP`, and `GITHUB_BRANCH` = `main`.
3. In GitHub → repository → *Settings* → *Secrets and variables* → *Actions*: add the secret `BUILD_CALLBACK_TOKEN` (copy the value of the same variable from Render) and the variable `API_BASE_URL` = your Render address.

### What the app does against the test track

A build made with `SCHOOL` and `API_BASE_URL` (the workflow passes both) signs in with the school's real accounts (password, then the code; the demo school hands out `424242`) and reads every screen from the family API (`/v1/f/*`). What a teacher marks in the app shows up in the admin. Not yet: hiding tabs for switched-off modules, library catalogue, gallery, live transport, push.

## Updating

Pushing to `main` redeploys automatically. Database changes are applied by the server at start; schools get theirs from the console under **Migrations** and **Releases**.

## Using real infrastructure later

The same steps run on AWS: a cell in the console gets the `aws-cell` target, and the blueprints under **Blueprints** describe what is created for each school. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-14-edunest-platform-design.md`.
