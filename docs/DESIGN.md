# EduNest "Nest" design concept

The design language of the **school admin** and the **console**. (The mobile app keeps its own "Chalk & Glass" language: `docs/design-system.md`.) This file is written so it can be turned into a skill: it states the idea, the tokens, every component, the motion, the states, the page recipes and the checks, with the reasons. The source of truth for exact values is `packages/web-ui/src/nest.css` (copied verbatim from `design/canvas/nest.css`); the approved boards are in `design/canvas/` (see `design/README.md`).

## 1. The idea

A calm, bright, rounded workspace for people who run a school all day: office staff, principals, and the small EduNest team behind them. It should feel like a well-made modern SaaS product, not a school and not a toy.

- **One floating frame.** The whole product sits in a large rounded "frame" lifted off a soft violet-tinted page. Inside: a quiet menu on the left and the page on the right. It feels like an object, not a full-bleed web page.
- **Soft violet as the voice, warm amber and coral as the accents.** Violet marks what is active and primary; amber draws the eye to the one number that matters; coral and red say "look at this"; green says "done/healthy".
- **Big friendly numbers, small honest labels.** Headings and figures use a characterful display face; everything else is a clean sans. Numbers are the heroes (attendance, money, counts) and roll when they change.
- **Rounded everything, but disciplined.** Pills for controls, large radii for containers, never sharp corners, never mixed radii in one group.
- **Motion that explains.** Things rise in, morph open, vibrate when wrong, draw their lines once. Nothing moves without a reason; reduced motion turns it all into instant states.
- **Honest.** No invented features, no fake numbers dressed as data (decorative sample cards are allowed only on the sign-in panel), no cute mascots. Empty and error states are first-class pages with an illustration, one true sentence and the next step.
- **What it is not:** it is not "Chalk & Glass" (no glass blur, no chalkboard), not playful (no mascots, pencil-shaped bars, jars, dot rows, confetti characters), not dense enterprise grey.

Why: the owner wanted admin and console to look like one consistent, premium product (references picked by the owner: modern SaaS dashboards, rounded cards, bold numerals) and explicitly rejected themed metaphors. Childish elements from the first canvas draft were replaced in the build (`design/README.md`).

## 2. Tokens

All tokens are CSS variables on `.nest` (light) and `.nest.dark` (dark). **Never hard-code colours in components; use the variables.** The theme follows the device (`prefers-color-scheme`) unless the person chose one from the account menu (`localStorage edunest.theme`); the root gets the `dark` class.

### Colour (light / dark)

| Role | Variable | Light | Dark | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page background | `--bd` | `#E9E5FB` (+ violet and peach radial glows) | `#07060B` | Behind the frame |
| Frame | `--frame` | `#FBFAFE` | `#0E0C15` | The big rounded surface |
| Card | `--card` | `#FFFFFF` | `#161320` | Cards, inputs, dialogs |
| Sunk | `--sunk` | `#F4F2FA` | `#1D192B` | Inset areas, tracks, hover fill, chips |
| Menu bg | `--sbg` | `#F6F4FC` | `#0B0910` | Side menu |
| Lines | `--line` / `--line2` | `#EAE7F4` / `#DAD5EC` | `#241F35` / `#332D4D` | Hairlines / input borders |
| Ink | `--ink` / `--ink2` / `--ink3` | `#14111F` / `#575270` / `#8C87A3` | `#F4F2FB` / `#B4AFCB` / `#7C7796` | Text: primary / secondary / tertiary |
| Primary button | `--pri` / `--priT` | ink / white | inverted | Black pill (white in dark) |
| **Violet** | `--v` (`--vS` soft, `--vD` deep, `--v2` mid, `--vL` light) | `#6A4CF5` | `#8E78FF` | Brand, active, focus, primary data |
| **Amber** | `--a` (`--aS`, `--aD`) | `#FFC23D` | `#FFCB52` | The highlighted metric, "late", warnings |
| **Coral** | `--c` (`--cS`, `--cD`) | `#FF7A59` | `#FF8A6B` | Secondary accent, "needs you" panel |
| **Green** | `--g` (`--gS`, `--gD`) | `#17A673` | `#3DD6A0` | Done, healthy, paid, present |
| **Blue** | `--b` (`--bS`) | `#3B82F6` | `#6AA3FF` | Info, "updating", transport |
| **Red** | `--r` (`--rS`) | `#E5484D` | `#FF6369` | Errors, overdue, danger, absent |
| Dark card | `--ci` | `#17141F` | `#26213A` | Dark tiles inside light pages, tooltips, ink panels |

Colour rules:

- Text on violet, red, green, blue and dark tiles is white; on amber it is `#14111F`.
- Contrast: body text ≥ 4.5:1. A school's brand colour is checked with `contrastRatio(colour, '#FFFFFF') >= 4.5` before it can be used behind white text (Settings shows "Passes AA · 5.3:1").
- Status is never colour alone: pill text says Healthy/Degraded/Down; charts have labels and tooltips.
- One accent per tile. Tiles: `t-v` violet, `t-a` amber, `t-i` ink, `t-l` light violet, `t-p` coral-soft, `t-g` mint.
- Tints for people: a name hashes to one of ten approved background/ink pairs (`tintFor`), so a person always has the same avatar colour.

### Type

- Display: **Bricolage Grotesque** 500/700/800 (`--fd`, class `fd`). Page titles 30–34 px/700, tile numbers 38–54 px, card titles 17–22 px; tight tracking (−.025 to −.04em).
- Body/UI: **Manrope** 400–800 (`--fb`). Labels 12–13 px/700, row text 14–15 px/600, paragraphs 14–15.5 px/500 with line-height 1.45–1.6. Devanagari: Noto Sans Devanagari (for Hindi/Marathi).
- Numbers use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` (class `num`).
- Small caps labels: 11.5 px/800, uppercase, +.06em tracking, `--ink3` (`lbl`).
- Sentence case everywhere. Plain words ("Waiting for approval", "Not marked"), never jargon in front of staff.

### Shape, depth, spacing

- Radii: frame 28, big tiles/cards 24–28, inputs 16, row cards 18–20, pills/buttons 999, avatars 50%. Bars: 7–14 px radius equal to half the height.
- Shadows: `--sh1` hairline (cards), `--sh2` hover lift (violet-tinted), `--sh3` floating (frame, dialogs, toast). In dark, shadows become pure black or none.
- Spacing scale (px): 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 26, 34. Page gutter 34 (desktop) / 16 (phone); grid gap 18; card padding 22; list rows min-height 58–64; touch targets ≥ 40.
- Layout: 12-column grid (`grid`, spans `s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s12`), collapsing to one column under 1100 px. Page width fills the frame.
- Focus: 2.5 px violet ring, 3 px offset, on every interactive element. Never remove it.

## 3. Structure of a page

```
page background (violet glow, radial gradients)
└─ frame (rounded 28, sh3)                       ← .fr
   ├─ menu (272 px, collapsible to 88 px)         ← .sb  (sticky, scrolls itself on short windows)
   │    workspace/school block · group labels · items (icon, label, shortcut hint or count)
   │    context card (term countdown / "requests to approve") · account block (menu: theme, sign out)
   └─ main (.mn)
        title row (h1 34px display, one-line sub, spacer, search pill, actions)
        content grid of tiles and cards
   overlays: palette (Ctrl K), dialogs, drawer, toast, bulk bar, support frame
```

- **Menu items** are links (work with middle-click and keyboard), highlight with a violet-soft pill, show `G D`-style keyboard hints (press `G` then a letter) or a count badge. Groups: admin Teach / People / Money / Reach / School; console Operate / Ship / Care.
- **Phone (≤ 900 px):** the menu is replaced by a floating **dock** (pill, ink background, four icons; the current one opens to show its name) and a **More** sheet that lists the full menu and sign out. The dashboard becomes a dedicated phone home (two big tiles, a summary, "Needs you" with Approve/Undo, a bars card). All other pages stack to one column; tables scroll sideways inside their card or stack their controls; card title rows wrap; segmented controls scroll.
- **Page header:** `h1` + one short sentence of context ("1,498 enrolled across 42 sections"). Primary action on the right, black pill. Search pill shows `Ctrl K`.
- **Command palette:** Ctrl/Cmd K or `/`; groups (People, Go to, Actions); arrows, Enter, Esc; shows shortcuts.

## 4. Components (use the real ones from `packages/web-ui`)

| Component | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| **Button** `.btn` | Pill, 42 px (34 `sm`), 700 14 px, 1.5 px border; hover lifts 1 px, press scales .96. Variants: `pri` (ink), `v` (violet, glows on hover), `wht` (white on dark tiles), `ghost`, `dng` (soft red), `dngf` (solid red, destructive confirm). Disabled 38 % opacity. Busy = spinner + word ("Saving…"). One primary per view. |
| **Chip** `.chip` | 26 px pill, 12 px/700; tones plain, `v c a g r b k`. Counts and states ("56", "Not yet", "Draft"). |
| **Status pill** `.st` | 28 px pill with a dot: `g` Healthy/Paid/Live, `a` Degraded/Waiting, `b` Updating/Setting up, `r` Down/Overdue, `n` neutral. Always includes a word. |
| **Card** `.card` | White, 1 px line, radius 24, padding 22, `sh1`. Header row `.ch`: title 17–22 px display + chip + optional small button; wraps on phones. |
| **Tile** `.tile t-*` | Coloured feature card, radius 28, a label chip, a big display number, a one-line explanation, optional corner arrow button. 3–4 per row at the top of a page. |
| **Inputs** `.inp`/`Field` | 48 px, radius 16, 1.5 px border; focus = violet border + 5 px soft ring; label above (13.5 px/700); hint below in `--ink3`; error: red border, tint, message with a warning icon, and the field **vibrates** (see motion). `SelectField` is a styled native select. |
| **Switch** `.sw` | 48×28 pill; knob springs. Always paired with a label. |
| **Segmented** `.seg` | Pill track with a sliding white knob (`kn`); tabs, view switches, ranges. |
| **Morph menu** `.morph` | A button that grows into its own list (width/height transition) instead of a popover; items stagger in; checkmark on the chosen. |
| **Table** `.grd` | CSS-grid rows (`--cols`), 58–64 px, hairline separators, hover tint, header row 11.5 px uppercase. Rows are links where they open something. Wrap in `.scroll-x` with a min-width on phones. |
| **Usage bar** `.bar` | **14 px tall**, full radius, `--sunk` track, violet→coral fill; `warn` variant amber→red; label left, value right. **Bars are never thin** (owner rule). Segmented tick bars (`tk3`, 20 ticks, 24 px tall) for SMS credits; release progress is 60 ticks. |
| **Charts** | Columns: wide, rounded tops, today highlighted in amber, previous period as a ghost behind, hover bubble. Lines: 3 px violet, drawn once, area gradient below, dashed previous line, follow-pointer tooltip. Roll bars: segmented present/late/absent, filled. Fee bars: filled, labelled with percent. No pencils, jars or dot rows. Goal line dashed with a chip. Empty chart: columns hidden, one sentence ("Attendance appears here after the first roll call is marked."). |
| **Ticket** `.tkt` | The plan card: dark gradient, notched sides (CSS mask), dashed perforation, plan name display 23 px, two icon lines, a white pill button, status chip and counts on the right. |
| **Dialog** | Centered card over a blurred scrim, tag chip above the title, focus trapped, Esc and scrim close. Dark variant for dangerous actions (erase). Typed-confirmation input for irreversible actions. |
| **Drawer** | Right panel that slides in (student detail). |
| **Toast** | Dark pill, bottom centre, green check or red cross circle + one sentence; auto-hides after ~4 s; never the only place an error appears. |
| **Save bar** | Floating dark pill "You have unsaved changes · Discard · Save" when a form is dirty. |
| **Support frame** | Red inset frame around the window plus a red pill "EduNest support in <school> · read-only · mm:ss left · End session". |
| **Avatar** `.av` | 34–76 px circle, initials, tint pair; stacks overlap by 8 px with a ring. |
| **Illustration** | 12 flat object scenes (register, noticeboard, receipt, notebooks, search-paper, checklist, plug, padlock, torn-page, envelope, map-pin, calendar): thick near-black outline, flat violet/amber/coral/green fills, soft ellipse shadow, strokes draw in once. **No faces, characters, animals, mascots.** Colours follow the theme. |
| **Empty card** `EmptyCard` | Header (title, chip with the zero, a ghost placeholder pill), centred illustration, 22 px display heading, 14.5 px body, 1–2 actions. Variants: empty, error (red chip, "Try again"), not found (404 tile with the big "4 0 4" and "This page skipped class."). |
| **Skeleton** `.skc` | Shimmering rounded block with the final layout's size, so nothing jumps when data arrives. |

## 5. Motion

Easing: `--e` = `cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)` (smooth out) for movement; `--sp` = `cubic-bezier(.34,1.56,.64,1)` (spring) for pops, switches and knobs. Durations: hover/colour 200–300 ms, movement 400–700 ms, page entrance 700 ms with a stagger of ~50 ms between blocks (`rise` + `--d` delay, capped), chart draws 2 s once.

| Pattern | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Rise** | Blocks enter 18 px lower with a fade, staggered top to bottom. |
| **Roll digits** | Each digit scrolls on a vertical strip to its new value (`Roll`, 1.1 em per digit); separators stay still. |
| **Morph** | Menus grow from their button (width, height) and items fade in with a delay per item. |
| **Vibrate (errors)** | `nShkA`/`nShkB`: ±9 px horizontal shake over .6 s. Two keyframe names alternate (`shk1`/`shk2` on a wrapper, `useShake().hit()`), so the same error can vibrate again and again. Used for wrong passwords, wrong codes, invalid fields, a failed save, a wrong typed confirmation. The error message also fades down (`nEm`). |
| **Pop** | Success marks scale from .6 with the spring. |
| **Draw** | Chart lines and illustration strokes draw once (dash offset). |
| **Hover lift** | Cards/tiles rise 2–4 px (ticket also tilts −.3°); arrow buttons rotate 45°. |
| **Live pulse** | The environment dot and the "now" tick pulse softly. |
| **Sign-in** | A panel with floating sample cards, rolling digits, a toast that appears, and a padlock illustration that rocks when a credential is wrong; the form shakes. |
| **Reduced motion** | `prefers-reduced-motion` (and the `rm` class) removes movement, keeps state changes instant. Never rely on motion to convey meaning. |

Animate transform and opacity only; never animate layout properties in lists.

### Scrolling and fitting (rules added 2026-10-18)

- Every scroll area has a visible, themed bar (thin, violet, a pill) and a soft shadow at the edge that still has more behind it (`polish.css`; add `.lscroll` to a list that can grow long, `.scl` to any other box).
- A list longer than about 12 rows scrolls inside its card (`max-height: min(66dvh, 680px)`); the page never grows with the data.
- The menu fits a short window: tighter rows under 900 px high, no context card under 780 px, and the account block stays pinned at the bottom.
- Text that names a person or thing wraps to two lines before it is cut; a one-line ellipsis is for previews only, and the full text is in the `title`.
- On a phone a list keeps only its main columns (class `hs` hides the rest) or stacks its row; a board scrolls sideways with snap.

## 6. States (every page must have all of them)

1. **Loading:** skeletons shaped like the final page (`aria-busy`). Spinners only inside buttons.
2. **Empty (brand-new school):** `EmptyCard` with what will appear here and what to do; never a blank table or a lone "No data".
3. **Error:** `EmptyCard error` with the server's honest sentence and "Try again".
4. **Partial/forbidden:** if a permission is missing, show the page read-only with a plain sentence ("You can look at attendance but not change it."), disabled controls with a title, not a hidden page.
5. **Conflict/locked:** a stale settings save explains who changed it; locked settings are disabled with a note.
6. **Success:** toast + the page already updated (optimistic where safe, with Undo for approvals).
7. **Waking server (free hosting):** skeletons stay until the first answer.

Copy rules: say what happened and what to do, in the person's words ("That didn't load", "Nothing has been posted yet"); no codes or stack traces; numbers formatted for India (`1,49,800`, `₹22L`, IST dates "Sat 17 Oct").

## 7. Page recipes

- **Dashboard:** welcome tile (avatar, greeting, quick buttons) · three KPI tiles (amber: present today with rolling digits and delta chip; violet: fees collected; ink: approvals waiting with avatar stack) · wide chart tile (tabs Attendance/Fees/Homework, range menu) · coral "Needs you" list with Approve/Review/Remind/Publish and Undo · class roll bars · fees by type · "Today at school" timeline · dashed "Add a widget".
- **List page (Students):** header with Import/Export/Add · view tabs (All / My class / Fees overdue / New) with counts · filter pills + dashed Add filter · four-figure summary strip · table card with sortable headers, select-all, row kebab, bulk bar, pagination footer · drawer for detail.
- **Timetable:** class morph menu, Week/Day/List segmented, publish button, week stepper, subject legend, grid with colour per subject, clash cell outlined red with a fix panel on the right, load ring and unplaced list.
- **Settings:** left section list (General, Modules…), grouped rows (label+help left, control right), brand colour swatches with live preview and contrast chip, toggles, plan ticket + SMS credits card, dirty save bar.
- **Roll call / simple list pages:** table card + a summary tile + a save card; big three-way toggle per row (Present green, Late amber, Absent red).
- **Console fleet:** release tile (progress ticks, wave dots, pause/roll back), schools tile, health tile (stacked bar and counts), requests chart, cells list with ring gauges, schools table, incident card, "waiting schools" tile.
- **Console school:** breadcrumb, logo + name + status chip, tabs, vertical step timeline with a dark log, ticket, usage card, store checklist.
- **Wizard:** left step list (done steps get a green check) and one card per step; one decision per screen; review screen lists exactly what Launch will do; rehearse before launch.
- **Dangerous action:** dark dialog, red tag, explain consequences, typed slug, vibrate on mismatch, solid red button.

## 8. Rules checklist (a design review should check each)

1. Uses only variables from `nest.css`; works in light and dark.
2. Radii and spacing from the scales; no new one-off sizes.
3. One primary action per view; destructive actions are red and confirmed.
4. All bars ≥ 14 px (usage) and charts have chunky marks.
5. Every interactive element has a visible focus ring, a label (icon-only buttons have `aria-label`) and a ≥ 40 px target.
6. Errors: red, near the field, say what to do, vibrate.
7. Empty/loading/error states exist and use the shared components.
8. No horizontal page scroll at 360 px; tables scroll inside their card; nothing clipped (`tools/audit-ui.mjs` proves it).
9. Reduced motion respected.
10. No mascots, faces, pencils, jars, dot rows, glass blur, emoji icons; icons are the 24 px 1.7 px-stroke set in `icons.ts`.
11. Copy is plain, sentence case, India-formatted.
12. New class names do not collide with `nest.css` (search first) and page CSS is scoped `.pg-<page>`.

## 9. Anti-patterns (do not)

- Glass/blur panels, chalk textures, or anything from the mobile app's language.
- Thin bars, hairline progress lines used as data, pencil/jar/dot metaphors.
- Cartoon characters or animals for empty states.
- Colour-only status.
- Modals for things a menu or drawer can do; popovers where a morph fits.
- Hiding a page because of permissions (show it read-only).
- Fake data presented as real (placeholder numbers belong only on the sign-in panel).
- Different looks for admin vs console.

## 10. Turning this into a skill

A skill built from this file should: (1) load `nest.css` tokens and the component list as the vocabulary, (2) require the states in section 6 and the checklist in section 8 for every new page, (3) tell the model to reuse `packages/web-ui` components and `blocks.css` before writing CSS, (4) point at `design/canvas/preview.html` for the approved boards, and (5) require running `node tools/audit-ui.mjs` and `node tools/e2e-flows.mjs` before declaring a page done.
