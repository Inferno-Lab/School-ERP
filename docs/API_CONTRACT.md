# API contract

> **Status:** implemented. The school API serves these calls under the prefix `/v1/f` (for example `GET /v1/f/students/:id/fees`), scoped to the signed-in person, in the shapes below (`apps/api/src/school/family.controller.ts`, tests in `apps/api/test/family.test.ts`). The app's `ApiClient` adds the prefix, the `X-School` header and the token. Sign-in is the platform's own two steps, `POST /v1/auth/login` then `POST /v1/auth/verify`, not the `/auth/*` calls in the next section. Differences from the tables: leave requests, attendance marks and homework hand-ins are stored in the same tables the admin uses; gallery is empty; library lists loans only (reserve answers 409); transport has the route only; notifications are the messages the school sent to the person's phone (read and dismiss state is kept per person).

Each repository method maps to one REST call. `Remote*Repository` calls these paths through `RemoteDataSource` and `ApiClient` (`lib/core/network/api_client.dart`). A build without `SCHOOL` and `API_BASE_URL` keeps `AppConfig.useMockData` on and never touches the network; a build with them uses these calls.

JSON bodies and responses use the shapes in [MOCK_SCHEMA.md](MOCK_SCHEMA.md). Dates on the wire are ISO-8601. Enum fields use the JSON values listed there (`late`, not the Dart name `lateArrival`; `class`, not `klass`).

## Errors

Failures are a JSON object:

```json
{ "message": "errors.bad_login" }
```

The real server sends `{ "code", "message" }`, where `message` is a sentence for people (the client shows it as is) and `code` a machine word. HTTP status is 400 for validation, 401 for auth, 403 for a missing permission, 404 for a missing id, 409 for a conflict and 500 for anything else. `ApiClient` turns a non-2xx body into `AppException(message)` and a failed connection into `errors.network`.

## Auth

As built: `POST /v1/auth/login` `{ "identifier", "password", "client"? }` answers `{ "step": "otp", "challenge": { "challengeId", "maskedTo", "expiresInSeconds", "demoCode"? } }` (or the tokens when the school switched the code off). `client` is `web` or `mobile` (mobile if omitted). `POST /v1/auth/verify` `{ "challengeId", "code", "client"? }` answers `{ "accessToken", "expiresInSeconds", "user", "refreshToken"? }`.

The phone app (`client: "mobile"`) gets `refreshToken` in the body, keeps both tokens in secure storage, and renews with `POST /v1/auth/refresh` `{ "refreshToken" }`. Each renewal returns a new refresh token; reusing an old one ends every session for that person and writes `auth.refresh_replayed`. Sessions last at most 30 days (14 idle).

The websites (`client: "web"`) keep the refresh token in an httpOnly cookie (`en_rt_<slug>` locally, `__Secure-en_rt_<slug>` in production, `Path=/v1/auth`, `SameSite=Strict`). The body has no refresh token. Refresh and logout send that cookie, an allowed `Origin`, and `x-csrf` matching the readable `en_csrf` cookie. Web sessions last 7 days. `POST /v1/auth/logout-all` ends every session for that person.

Every later request sends `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` and `X-School: <slug>`. The access JWT is 15 minutes, bound to the school (`aud`), and carries `sid` and `ver` (`users.token_version`). A revoked session, a role change, deactivation, or logout-all is refused on the next request (cached about 30 seconds). The app then reads the person from `GET /v1/f/me`. The table below is the demo app's original shape; the mock still uses it.

## Pagination

Collection GETs accept `page` (default 1) and `pageSize` (default 50). The response is either the raw array the repositories parse today, or:

```json
{ "items": [], "page": 1, "pageSize": 50, "total": 0 }
```

Remote parsers currently expect the raw array (or a single object). When a backend starts paginating, unwrap `items` in that repository only.

## Plug-ins (not built)

These stay behind their own interfaces so the demo does not pretend to talk to a vendor.

**Push.** `PushGateway.register(token)` and `PushGateway.revoke()`. The server stores the device token on `POST /devices`. Tapping a push opens the `route` already stored on a notification. The in-app list remains `NotificationRepository`.

**Payments.** `PaymentGateway.checkout({ installmentId, method, amount })` returns `{ status, reference }`. `FeeRepository.pay` calls it, then `POST /fees/:installmentId/pay` with that reference. UPI, card, and net banking in the sheet are labels only until a gateway is chosen.

**Live GPS.** `BusTracker.watch(busNo)` is a stream of `{ lat, lng, heading, etaMinutes }`. `TransportRepository.forStudent` stays the snapshot (route, stops, driver). The painted map would subscribe to the stream instead of the mock `progress` animation.
